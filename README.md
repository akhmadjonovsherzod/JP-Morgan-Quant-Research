JP Morgan Quantitative Research Analysis – Report

In summary, the natural gas price data show a gradual upward trend (~$0.039 per month) with mild seasonality; a storage strategy capturing the 2021–22 price spread yields a net margin of approximately $0.89 million when accounting for injection, withdrawal, transportation and storage costs. Machine-learning analysis of a 10 000‑loan portfolio demonstrates that an XGBoost model with engineered income‑to‑debt features achieves ~99 % classification accuracy and highlights a handful of borrowers as the main drivers of expected losses, which total roughly $7.42 million. Simplifying credit analysis by bucketing FICO scores into six ratings reveals a monotonic increase in default rates from 3 % to 37 %, but a rating-only logistic regression model attains only 81.8 % accuracy and tends to underestimate risk for the lowest‑quality borrowers.
